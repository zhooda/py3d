# py3d

3D Graphics engine written in Python 3 and Pygame. This is not a game engine, it's just a simple library of sorts to project 3D objects on a 2D screen. Most of the code is quite inefficient so if you see something you wanna fix, please make a pull request.

## Getting Started

These instructions *should* get you a copy of the project up and running
on your local machine. This is usually just for development and testing,
but we have no deployment strategies, so have at it.

#### Prerequisites

To use py3d you will need:

- [Python](https://www.python.org) 3.6+
- [Pygame](https://pygame.org) 1.9+

#### Installation

Clone to your home directory or checkout with SVN to get a copy of py3d.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhooda/py3d.git
```

## Usage

#### Running the main:
```bash
cd ~/py3d

python main.py
```

#### Using py3d as a library:

This is planned although no documentation is available. If you want to use the components right now, move the files into your program directory and import them. This should work fine as long as you have the dependencies installed.


## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change, but really, this project was written in a hurry so definitely open some pull requests :)
